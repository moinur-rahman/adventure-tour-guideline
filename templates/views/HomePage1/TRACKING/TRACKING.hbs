        Stretching 268 miles from the Derbyshire Peak District to the Scottish
        Borders, the Pennine Way is the United Kingdom's most famous long
        distance path. The entire walk takes around three weeks, passing over
        wild moorland east of Manchester and through the picture postcard
        Yorkshire Dales, before crossing the ancient border of Hadrian's Wall
        and on toward Scotland. One for outdoor fanatics, camping enthusiasts
        and anyone who can handle the vagaries of great British weather. The
        Pennine Way originally climbed north from Edale across the middle of the
        Kinder Scout plateau. It was rerouted to reduce erosion, and now heads
        west to climb onto the plateau by steps known as Jacob's Ladder. It then
        turns north to follow the western edge of the plateau past Kinder
        Downfall, crosses the Snake Pass road (A57) and climbs Bleaklow. From
        the summit the trail descends to Longdendale. In the dale it crosses the
        dam of Torside Reservoir to Crowden, the first village since the start
        of the trail 16 miles (26 km) away. The Pennine Way is popular with
        walkers, and in 1990 the Countryside Commission reported that 12,000
        long-distance walkers and 250,000 day-walkers were using all or part of
        the trail annually and that walkers contributed £2 million (1990) to the
        local economy along the route, directly maintaining 156 jobs.

        The Annapurna Circuit is a trek within the mountain ranges of central
        Nepal. The total length of the route varies between 160–230 km (100-145
        mi), depending on where motor transportation is used and where the trek
        is ended. This trek crosses two different river valleys and encircles
        the Annapurna Massif. The path reaches its highest point at Thorung La
        pass (5416m/17769 ft), touching the edge of the Tibetan plateau.
        Practically all trekkers hike the route anticlockwise, as this way the
        daily altitude gain is slower, and crossing the high Thorong La pass is
        easier and safer. In addition to the Annapurna Circuit Trek, Annapurna
        Seven Passes Trek or Annapurna Seven Hills trek is also popular in the
        region. However, this is less traversed and is off the beaten path trek
        in the region. The mountain scenery, seen at close quarters includes the
        Annapurna Massif (Annapurna I-IV), Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchhre, Manaslu,
        Gangapurna, Tilicho Peak, Pisang Peak, and Paungda Danda. Numerous other
        peaks of 6000-8000m in elevation rise from the Annapurna range. The trek
        begins at Besisahar or Bhulbhule in the Marshyangdi river valley and
        concludes in the Kali Gandaki Gorge. Besisahar can be reached after a
        seven-hour drive from Kathmandu. The trail passes along paddy fields and
        into subtropical forests, several waterfalls and gigantic cliffs, and
        various villages.

        The Camino de Santiago known in English as the Way of St. James, is a
        network of pilgrims' ways or pilgrimages leading to the shrine of the
        apostle Saint James the Great in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela
        in Galicia in northwestern Spain, where tradition has it that the
        remains of the saints are buried there. Many follow its routes as a form
        of spiritual path or retreat for their spiritual growth. It is also
        popular with hiking and cycling enthusiasts and organized tour groups.
        Way of St. James was one of the most important Christian pilgrimages
        during the later Middle Ages, and a pilgrimage route on which a plenary
        indulgence could be earned; other major pilgrimage routes include the
        Via Francigena to Rome and the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Legend holds
        that St. James's remains were carried by boat from Jerusalem to northern
        Spain, where he was buried in what is now the city of Santiago de
        Compostela. The Way can take one of dozens of pilgrimage routes to
        Santiago de Compostela. Traditionally, as with most pilgrimages, the Way
        of Saint James begins at one's home and ends at the pilgrimage site.
        However, a few of the routes are considered main ones. During the Middle
        Ages, the route was highly travelled. However, the Black Death, the
        Protestant Reformation, and political unrest in 16th century Europe led
        to its decline. By the 1980s, only a few hundred pilgrims per year
        registered in the pilgrim's office in Santiago. In October 1987, the
        route was declared the first European Cultural Route by the Council of
        Europe; it was also named one of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. Since
        the 1980s the route has attracted a growing number of modern-day
        international pilgrims.

        Toubkal or Tubkal s a mountain peak in southwestern Morocco, located in
        the Toubkal National Park.Although much of the High Atlas consists of
        sedimentary rocks, the Toubkal massif is an area of volcanic rocks which
        have weathered into alpine crests, cut by deep, narrow valleys. To the
        south, the mountain drops steeply down for 1,800 metres (5,906 ft) to a
        small lake called Lac d'Ifni. To the west, the mountain's edge is marked
        by a pass, the Tizi n'Ouanoums at 3,664 metres (12,021 ft). From this
        pass, the mountain's W-S-W ridge rises up to Toubkal West, which forms a
        shoulder at 4,020 metres (13,189 ft) before continuing to the summit at
        4,167 metres (13,671 ft). Toubkal is popular with trekkers and ski
        mountaineers, but less so with climbers, despite its ease of access and
        sunny climate. Trekkers usually approach the mountain from Marrakesh via
        the road-end village of Imlil. Qualified guides can be hired, as well as
        porters, to carry equipment and food supplies higher into the mountains.
        Since 2018, guides are now required even for the normal route,due to
        recent events on the trail (murder and deadly slips). Otherwise it is a
        moderate hike and navigation is not a problem.

        The last leg of the Hong Kong Trail, this meandering path on the ridge
        of Dragon’s Back is widely hailed as one of Hong Kong’s best urban
        hikes. Besides its attractive name, Dragon’s Back has a sightseeing
        platform near its peak that provides truly spectacular views of southern
        Hong Kong Island and its shoreline. Right at the trail’s end is Big Wave
        Bay. Take a dip or surf the waves for a relaxing finale to this hike.
        From Shek O Road, you will first walk through a shaded path onto this
        section of the Hong Kong Trail. About a minute into your hike, the path
        will open up to the sky as you ascend. After 20 minutes or so, you’ll
        find yourself on the Shek O Peninsula Viewing Point overlooking Shek O
        Beach on the foot of the hill, and also the two isles off Shek O
        Peninsula. lthough bare and exposed, the platform on the summit of Shek
        O Peak (284 m) is the perfect place to take in the panorama of the
        peninsula’s coastline. When you turn around to observe the winding
        trails, you’ll finally see how Dragon’s Back got its well-deserved name.
        Stay on the rolling ridge to trace the “dragon” while you climb uphill.
        Stop at the Dragon's Back Hike Viewing Point for a great view of the Tai
        Tam Bay west of Shek O Peninsula. On a clear day, even Lamma Island, to
        the southwest of Hong Kong Island, is visible from the deck. Once over
        the ridge, you'll arrive at Pottinger Gap. Here you get a view of Chai
        Wan’s urban high-rises against a forested landscape. After passing a
        pavilion, you’ll begin a sharp descent on an uneven stone and dirt path.
        This very last stage of the trail is mostly shaded and can be slippery
        at times. Once you’ve exited the trail and cleared the village houses, a
        beach popular with surfers lies waiting.

        The relative inaccessibility of Bhutan and need for tourist passes means
        its trails are unspoiled and ripe for exploration. Tergo-La Trek, in the
        Haa Valley, is one of the country's lesser known routes. This guided
        trek from Bhutanese tour operator Blue Poppy rises from 3,500 meters to
        4,135 meters, passing through peaceful forest paths and up wild mountain
        tracks, with views of Kanchenjunga, the third highest peak in the world.
        Yak herders' camps and distant villages add to the sense of being in
        another world. Tergo is the name for a series of forklift trucks from
        the Swedish manufacturer Atlet AB. In the 80’s Atlet AB was
        pioneering[1] in ergonomics and operator-centric development of trucks,
        following the idea that optimal operative efficiency is best created by
        first optimizing operator’s environment. The result of this philosophy
        was the Atlet Tergo® trucks that ever since have been manufactured in a
        variety of models and variants.

      <p>While the Routeburn Track may be a shorter multi-day hike, it has some
        of the biggest scenery. With soaring mountain peaks, huge valleys,
        waterfalls and jewel-like lakes the track links the Mount Aspiring
        National Park with Fiordland National Park.The highest point of the
        track is 1,255 metres above sea level - so the views are simply
        spectacular. The part of New Zealand that the Routeburn Track winds
        through has been shaped by successive glaciations into fiords, rocky
        coasts, towering cliffs, lakes and waterfalls. Birdlife is prolific
        through forested sections of the track; native tomtits, robins,
        fantails, wood pigeons and bellbirds are commonly seen, as well as the
        cheeky Kea, the world's only alpine parrot. This is not a loop track and
        can be walked in either direction; one track end is at the Routeburn
        Shelter (near Glenorchy) and the other is at The Divide (closer to Te
        Anau). It is recommended that this track is avoided between May -
        September, when there is high risk of avalanches. The walk is not a
        circuit, so transport needs to be organised at either end. Shuttles and
        buses are easy to book in advance. One end of the track begins near
        Queenstown, where there are plentiful options for accommodation.

        Africa may not be on the top of most people’s list of places to hike,
        but this hidden gem is sure to please your inner Indiana Jones. This
        trail is set in the plains of West Africa and passes through the
        majestic Bandiagara Escarpment and abandoned cliff dwellings (very
        similar looking to Mesa Verde). The exotic natural beauty of the area
        will surely please your eyes, but the warm people will make the most
        lasting impression. Partant du fleuve Niger en direction du sud-est,
        vers le Burkina Faso, on rencontre successivement trois types de
        paysages : plateau, falaise et plaine.

        The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built
        across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and
        Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the
        Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th
        century BC,with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi
        Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall
        remains. Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have
        included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods
        transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade
        and the control of immigration and emigration.Furthermore, the defensive
        characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of
        watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities
        through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the
        Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor. he frontier walls
        built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they
        stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the
        present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the
        south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian
        steppe. A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced
        technologies, has concluded that the walls built by the Ming dynasty
        measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi).
