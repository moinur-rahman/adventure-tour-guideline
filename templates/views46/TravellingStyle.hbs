          <h1><b>Luxury vs. Budget</b></h1>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Whether you’re a luxury or a budget traveler depends less on your
            financial circumstance than on your need to roll like a millionaire
            everywhere you go. The luxury traveler (recognizable by brand-name
            luggage and designer sunglasses) always consults the latest trends
            in tourism before planning a vacation, paying close attention to
            where the hottest celebrities have stayed in the past. With passport
            stamps from Milan to Singapore and everywhere in between, the luxury
            traveler knows quality is always better than quantity.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Budget travelers, on the other hand, takes an entirely different
            approach. Savvy instincts help them make price-conscious choices
            like looking for the cheapest hostels, hopping on last minute flight
            deals, and bartering with the locals for the lowest price on flea
            market crafts. They may not be pampered and polished, but that’s all
            the more natural for these low-maintenance folks.

            It takes a certain kind of person to go on vacation alone. You’ve
            got to be fiercely independent, comfortable in unpredictable
            situations, and super outgoing. However, solo travel can be one of
            the most rewarding experiences out there. It’s a chance to pursue
            creative goals, like writing a novel, starting a photography
            project, or mastering another culture’s cuisine. Or, just take it as
            a mini-escape from the pressures of everyday life and an opportunity
            to get to know yourself better.
          </p>
          <p>
            But for those who prefer group travel, it’s a different story.
            Whether it’s a family reunion, a romantic getaway, or a girls-only
            trip, many hotels and packages cater to multiple travelers. And the
            advantages don’t stop there: what better way to spend time and money
            than with those you love most? The disadvantages? If you get in a
            fight, you’re stuck together for the rest of the trip.

          <h1><b>Adventure vs. Escape</b></h1>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Adrenaline junkies or thrill seekers, whatever you want to call
            them, are always searching for the next opportunity to jumpstart
            their heart. They can make any vacation more exciting. Planning to
            visit a big city? They’ll walk the streets as if they’re competing
            in a parkour competition. Going to the ocean? They’ll be the first
            to rent a surfboard and the last to leave the water.
          </p>
          <p>
            But not everyone can keep up, and not everyone even wants to. Escape
            travelers prefer a quiet, serene spa to hang their coats and their
            worries at the door. Who needs a zipline when there are saunas to
            spend hours in and books to be read by the beach?
          </p>

          <h1><b>City vs. Nature</b></h1>
          <hr />
          <p>
            If you’re the kind of person that keeps their finger on the pulse of
            whatever is the latest cuisine, exhibition opening, or fashion
            trend, a mountaineering vacation seems like a laughable proposition.
            City folks prefer to be surrounded by people and culture, and for
            those who say that all cities are the same, well, they just don’t
            appreciate the subtleties in architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, some would rather “get away from it all” by returning to
            Mother Earth’s roots. Skiing and hiking are fun activities rather
            than daunting physical tasks for the tree-hugging outdoorsy type.
            For them, no city can compare to the indescribable experience of
            white-water rafting through a wooded forest.

            Flyers like to get things done efficiently. They’ll deal with
            airport security, higher costs, and uncomfortable takeoffs all for
            the sake of getting there faster. Who has time for traffic? If
            you’re a frequent flyer, the thought of spending multiple hours
            squished next to a stranger isn’t nearly as bad as sitting in a
            smelly car stuck behind a Hummer on the highway.
          </p>
          <p>
            But for those who go by car, there’s a different set of priorities.
            Whatever happened to fun road games and family sing-a-longs? Even
            with the possibility of running out of gas or breaking down, there’s
            something nostalgic and romantic about heading out on a good
            old-fashioned road trip.
